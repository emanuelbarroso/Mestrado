	abstract="Water flooding is one of the most important techniques of improved oil recovery. However, two major problems, loss of injected water to the aquifer and unwanted water production, reduce the efficiency of water flooding. An improper allocation of water to injection wells usually is the main reason of these problems. In this paper, both multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) optimization, which is more rapid and accurate than conventional GA, and streamline simulation with the unique advantages of determination of flow path and participation of each injection well in total field oil production, were used in order to appease the mentioned problems. All previous studies have tried to optimize the injection rates based on injection efficiencies that were defined with the application of streamline simulation, while using MOGA optimization and Pareto concept always let us select the best global solutions with regard to the other defined criterions. Final solution in MOGA optimization is a set of correct answers. So, five scenarios, including different restrictions and economic situations were introduced. Best solution was obtained and compared with the common method of water injection optimization exclusively based on improving the efficiencies of injection wells. Results show that MOGA optimization always offers the best solution and all MOGA scenarios have better proficiencies than common optimization methods. Comparison of the proposed methodology in this paper with conventional workflow shows that MOGA, in the best case, can increase total oil production up to 6.5 {\%}, and after considering all limitations, it can increase total oil production up to 4 {\%} and decrease the loss of water to the aquifer to about 26 {\%} in comparison with the common workflows.",

	abstract="The objective of this paper is to introduce a novel paradigm to reduce the computational effort in waterflooding global optimization problems while realizing smooth well control trajectories amenable for practical deployments in the field. In order to overcome the problems of slow convergence and non-smooth impractical control strategies, often associated with gradient-free optimization (GFO) methods, we introduce a generalized approach which represent the controls by smooth polynomial approximations either by a polynomial function or by a piecewise polynomial interpolation, which we denote as function control method (FCM) and interpolation control method (ICM), respectively. Using these approaches, we aim to optimize the coefficients of the selected functions or the interpolation points in order to represent the well-control trajectories along a time horizon. Our results demonstrate significant computational savings, due to a substantial reduction in the number of control parameters, as we seek the optimal polynomial coefficients or the interpolation points to describe the control trajectories as opposed to directly searching for the optimal control values (bottom hole pressure) at each time interval. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method on two and three-dimensional models, where we found the optimal variables using a parallel dynamic-neighborhood particle swarm optimization (PSO). We compared our FCM-PSO and ICM-PSO to the traditional formulation solved by both gradient-free and gradient-based methods. In all comparisons, both FCM and ICM show very good to superior performances.",

	abstract="Determining optimal locations and operation parameters for wells in oil and gas reservoirs has a potentially high economic impact. Finding these optima depends on a complex combination of geological, petrophysical, flow regimen, and economical parameters that are hard to grasp intuitively. On the other hand, automatic approaches have in the past been hampered by the overwhelming computational cost of running thousands of potential cases using reservoir simulators, given that each of these runs can take on the order of hours. Therefore, the key issue to such automatic optimization is the development of algorithms that find good solutions with a minimum number of function evaluations. In this work, we compare and analyze the efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability of several optimization algorithms for the well placement problem. In particular, we consider the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), finite difference gradient (FDG), and very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) algorithms. None of these algorithms guarantees to find the optimal solution, but we show that both SPSA and VFSA are very efficient in finding nearly optimal solutions with a high probability. We illustrate this with a set of numerical experiments based on real data for single and multiple well placement problems.",

	abstract="Determining the optimum type and location of new wells is an essential component in the efficient development of oil and gas fields. The optimization problem is, however, demanding due to the potentially high dimension of the search space and the computational requirements associated with function evaluations, which, in this case, entail full reservoir simulations. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied for the determination of optimal well type and location. The PSO algorithm is a stochastic procedure that uses a population of solutions, called particles, which move in the search space. Particle positions are updated iteratively according to particle fitness (objective function value) and position relative to other particles. The general PSO procedure is first discussed, and then the particular variant implemented for well optimization is described. Four example cases are considered. These involve vertical, deviated, and dual-lateral wells and optimization over single and multiple reservoir realizations. For each case, both the PSO algorithm and the widely used genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to maximize net present value. Multiple runs of both algorithms are performed and the results are averaged in order to achieve meaningful comparisons. It is shown that, on average, PSO outperforms GA in all cases considered, though the relative advantages of PSO vary from case to case. Taken in total, these findings are very promising and demonstrate the applicability of PSO for this challenging problem.",

	abstract="There is no gainsaying that determining the optimal number, type, and location of hydrocarbon reservoir wells is a very important aspect of field development planning. The reason behind this fact is not farfetched---the objective of any field development exercise is to maximize the total hydrocarbon recovery, which for all intents and purposes, can be measured by an economic criterion such as the net present value of the reservoir during its estimated operational life-cycle. Since the cost of drilling and completion of wells can be significantly high (millions of dollars), there is need for some form of operational and economic justification of potential well configuration, so that the ultimate purpose of maximizing production and asset value is not defeated in the long run. The problem, however, is that well optimization problems are by no means trivial. Inherent drawbacks include the associated computational cost of evaluating the objective function, the high dimensionality of the search space, and the effects of a continuous range of geological uncertainty. In this paper, the differential evolution (DE) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are applied to well placement problems. The results emanating from both algorithms are compared with results obtained by applying a third algorithm called hybrid particle swarm differential evolution (HPSDE)---a product of the hybridization of DE and PSO algorithms. Three cases involving the placement of vertical wells in 2-D and 3-D reservoir models are considered. In two of the three cases, a max-mean objective robust optimization was performed to address geological uncertainty arising from the mismatch between real physical reservoir and the reservoir model. We demonstrate that the performance of DE and PSO algorithms is dependent on the total number of function evaluations performed; importantly, we show that in all cases, HPSDE algorithm outperforms both DE and PSO algorithms. Based on the evidence of these findings, we hold the view that hybridized metaheuristic optimization algorithms (such as HPSDE) are applicable in this problem domain and could be potentially useful in other reservoir engineering problems.",

	abstract="Determining the optimum placement of new wells in an oil field is a crucial work for reservoir engineers. The optimization problem is complex due to the highly nonlinearly correlated and uncertain reservoir performances which are affected by engineering and geologic variables. In this paper, the combination of a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm and quality map method (QM + MPSO), modified particle swarm optimization algorithm (MPSO), standard particle swarm optimization algorithm (SPSO), and centered-progressive particle swarm optimization (CP-PSO) are applied for optimization of well placement. The SPSO, CP-PSO, and MPSO algorithms are first discussed, and then the modified quality map method is discussed, and finally the implementation of these four methods for well placement optimization is described. Four example cases which involve depletion drive model, water injection model, and a real field reservoir model, with the maximization of net present value (NPV) as the objective function are considered. The physical model used in the optimization analyses is a 3-dimensional implicit black-oil model. Multiple runs of all methods are performed, and the results are averaged in order to achieve meaningful comparisons. In the case of optimizing placement of a single producer well, it is shown that it is not necessary to use the quality map to initialize the position of well placement. In other cases considered, it is shown that the QM + MPSO method outperforms MPSO method, and MPSO method outperforms SPSO and CP-PSO method. Taken in total, the modification of SPSO method is effective and the applicability of QM + MPSO for this challenging problem is promising",

Obtaining even a single history-matched reservoir model requires a substantial amount of effort, but the past decade has seen remarkable progress in the ability to generate reservoir simulation models that match large amounts of production data. Progress can be partially attributed to an increase in computational power, but the widespread adoption of geostatistics and Monte Carlo methods has also contributed indirectly. In this review paper, we will summarize key developments in history matching and then review many of the accomplishments of the past decade, including developments in reparameterization of the model variables, methods for computation of the sensitivity coefficients, and methods for quantifying uncertainty. An attempt has been made to compare representative procedures and to identify possible limitations of each.",
